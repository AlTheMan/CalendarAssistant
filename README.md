**CALENDER ASSISTANT**

Combines travel information with calendar apps to help notify users of their departures. <br>

This app gives you automatic reminders before your departures. Log in with your google account, and the app will automatically sync to your google calendar and show you notifications when you need to leave in order to  arrive at your events in your calender in time. You can select between different modes of transportation; 'car', 'public transport', 'biking', and 'walking'. Delays and deviations will be shown, and the transportation route is presented. Each step of the departure will be displayed. You can also set an offset-timer for notifications. If you set the off-set timer to 10, you will be notified 10 minutes before you need to leave.
